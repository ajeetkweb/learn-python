Multiprocessing:

  Multiprocessing in Python is a technique that allows you to create and manage multiple processes
  to execute tasks concurrently.

  CPU-bound tasks are operations that require intensive computation and make heavy use of the CPU.
  Examples include mathematical computations, image processing, or scientific simulations.
